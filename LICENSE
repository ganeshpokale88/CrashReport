## HIPAA Compliance Disclaimer

**IMPORTANT: This library is NOT fully HIPAA compliant.**

While this library includes security features such as encryption, data sanitization,
and secure key storage, it does NOT yet meet all HIPAA requirements. Missing
features include audit logging, user consent mechanisms, certificate pinning,
and breach detection.

**YOU MUST VERIFY COMPLIANCE** before using this library in HIPAA-regulated
environments. The library developer assumes NO liability for HIPAA violations,
security breaches, or compliance failures.

**Security Benefits:**
- Data is sent to YOUR server, not a third party
- You maintain full control over crash data
- No vendor lock-in or data sharing with external services

**Verification Required:**
- Review HIPAA compliance checklist before use (library-side only)
- Verify your server implementation meets HIPAA requirements (your responsibility)
- Consult with legal/compliance experts
- Test thoroughly in your environment

**Important:** This library only handles client-side security. Server-side compliance
(BAA, server encryption, access controls, audit logging, etc.) is your responsibility
and must be implemented separately on your server.

Use of this library in healthcare/HIPAA applications is at your own risk.
